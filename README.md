# Meowgram — Mobile App

Meowgram is a mobile-first social app for cat lovers. It lets users share photos, follow other cat profiles, and interact in a lightweight social feed designed for quick browsing and delightful interactions.

This repository contains the mobile app source code (React Native / Expo or plain React Native depending on the project setup). Use this README as an entry point for running, developing, and contributing to the app.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS)
- npm or yarn
- Android Studio (for Android emulator) and/or Xcode (for iOS simulator / builds)
- Java JDK (for Android)
- A backend API (URL and API keys) or a local mock server if the app depends on one

If this project uses Expo:

- expo-cli: `npm install -g expo-cli`

### Install

1. Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/blagojevics/meowgram-mobile-app.git
2. Enter the project directory
   cd meowgram-mobile-app
3. Install dependencies
   npm install
   or
   yarn install

### Environment variables

Create a `.env` file at the project root (or follow the app-specific env pattern) and add variables required by the project. Example vars you might need:

```
API_URL=https://api.example.com
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_key
FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_key
STORAGE_BUCKET=...
```

Never commit real secret keys. Use `.env.example` to document required variables.

### Run (development)

If this is an Expo app:

- Start Metro / Expo
  npm start
  or
  yarn start
- Use Expo Go on your device or run in an emulator:
  - iOS: press `i` or run `expo run:ios`
  - Android: press `a` or run `expo run:android`

If this is bare React Native:

- Start Metro
  npm run start
- Run on Android
  npm run android
- Run on iOS
  npm run ios

Refer to package.json scripts for exact commands.

## Building for release

Android:

- Generate a release keystore
- Configure `android/app/build.gradle` with keystore settings
- `cd android && ./gradlew assembleRelease`

iOS:

- Open `ios/Meowgram.xcworkspace` in Xcode
- Set signing & capabilities
- Archive and export for App Store submission

If using Expo, follow Expo's build docs:

- `eas build` (recommended)
- Or `expo build:android` / `expo build:ios` for classic builds (depending on Expo version)

---

## Testing

- Unit tests: (Jest) — run `npm test` or `yarn test` if tests exist
- E2E tests: (Detox / Appium) — configure device/emulator and run test commands if implemented

Add tests as features are stabilized.

---

## Contributing

## Roadmap / Future plans

Planned enhancements (short/medium term):

- Google Sign-In

  - Add OAuth-based authentication so users can sign in with Google accounts.
  - Support linking existing accounts and account recovery flows.

- Chat / Direct Messaging

  - Real-time chat between users (1:1 DMs, group chats).
  - Typing indicators, read receipts, message attachments.

- iOS App Store release

  - Prepare an App Store listing, screenshots, privacy policy, and comply with App Store review guidelines.
  - Implement App Store-specific build and CI pipelines.

- More styling and features

  - UI polish and consistent design system.
  - Additional profile customization, reactions, post editing, and advanced search/filtering.
  - Accessibility improvements and internationalization.

- Other possible items
  - Push notifications (Firebase / APNs)
  - Content moderation tools and reporting
  - Analytics and crash reporting
  - Performance improvements and offline sync

If you'd like to prioritize or expand any of these, open issues or assign tasks and I can help break them down into actionable PRs.

## Known issues / Troubleshooting

- If images fail to upload, verify `API_URL`, storage credentials, and CORS settings on the backend.
- If Android build fails with gradle errors, try clearing Gradle cache and running `cd android && ./gradlew clean`.
- For iOS code signing problems, ensure correct provisioning profiles and team settings in Xcode.

Add project-specific troubleshooting steps as they arise.
